# Iris Classification with Scikit-Learn

A machine learning project that classifies iris flowers into three species — *setosa*, *versicolor*, and *virginica* — using the classic Iris dataset and Scikit-Learn's classification algorithms.

## Overview

The Iris dataset is a famous dataset in machine learning and statistics, introduced by the British biologist and statistician Ronald Fisher. This project uses the dataset to build a classification model using K-Nearest-Neighbors that can predict the species of an iris flower based on its sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.
